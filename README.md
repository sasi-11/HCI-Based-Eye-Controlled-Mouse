# HCI-Based-Eye-Controlled-Mouse
• The system built is an eye & face-based interface that acts as a computer mouse to translate 3 face movements and 3 other eye movements such as blinking, gazing, and squinting towards the mouse cursor actions.

• This system plans to make use of a simple webcam and its 3 basic software requirements are Python, OpenCV, NumPy, and a few other packages that are necessary for face recognition.
# Brief Discussion
With advanced technologies in this digital era, there is always scope for development in the field of computing. Hands-free computing is in demand as of today it addresses the needs of quadriplegics (people affected by paralysis of all four limbs). Here, we propose to present a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) system that is of great importance to amputees and those who have issues with using their hands. The system built is an eye-based interface that acts as a computer mouse to translate eye movements such as blinking, gazing, and squinting towards the mouse cursor actions. This system plans to make use of a simple webcam and its software requirements are Python, OpenCV, NumPy, and a few other packages which are necessary for face recognition. The face detector can be built using the HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) feature along with a linear classifier, and the sliding window technique. It is hands-free and no external hardware or sensors are required.
